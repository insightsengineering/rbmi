\title{Create an imputation object}
\usage{
as_imputation(imputations, data, method, references)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputations}{A list of \code{imputations_list}'s as created by \code{\link[=as_imputation_list]{as_imputation_list()}}}

\item{data}{A \code{longdata} object as created by \code{\link[=longDataConstructor]{longDataConstructor()}}}

\item{method}{A \code{method} object as created by \code{\link[=method_condmean]{method_condmean()}}, \code{\link[=method_bayes]{method_bayes()}} or
\code{\link[=method_approxbayes]{method_approxbayes()}}}

\item{references}{A named vector. Identifies the references to be used when generating the
imputed values. Should be of the form \code{c("Group" = "Reference", "Group" = "Reference")}.}
}
\description{
This function creates the object that is returned from \code{\link[=impute]{impute()}}. Essentially
it is a glorified wrapper around \code{\link[=list]{list()}} ensuring that the required elements have been
set and that the class is added as expected.
