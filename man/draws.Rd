\description{
\code{draws} fits the base imputation model to the observed outcome data
according to the given multiple imputation methodology.
According to the user's method specification, it returns either draws from the posterior distribution of the
model parameters as required for Bayesian multiple imputation or frequentist parameter estimates from the
original data and bootstrapped or leave-one-out datasets as required for conditional mean imputation.
The purpose of the imputation model is to estimate model parameters
in the absence of intercurrent events (ICEs) handled using reference-based imputation methods.
For this reason, any observed outcome data after ICEs, for which reference-based imputation methods are
specified, are removed and considered as missing for the purpose of estimating the imputation model, and for
this purpose only. The imputation model is a mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) model that is valid
under a missing-at-random (MAR) assumption.
It can be fit using frequentist maximum likelihood (ML) or restricted ML (REML) estimation,
a Bayesian approach, or an approximate Bayesian approach according to the user's method specification.
The ML/REML approaches and the approximate Bayesian approach support several possible covariance structures,
while the Bayesian approach based on MCMC sampling supports only an unstructured covariance structure.
In any case the covariance matrix can be assumed to be the same or different across each group.
}
\details{
\code{draws} performs the first step of the multiple imputation (MI) procedure: fitting the
base imputation model. The goal is to estimate the parameters of interest needed
for the imputation phase (i.e. the regression coefficients and the covariance matrices
from a MMRM model).

The function distinguishes between the following methods:
\itemize{
\item Bayesian MI based on MCMC sampling: \code{draws} returns the draws
from the posterior distribution of the parameters using a Bayesian approach based on
MCMC sampling. This method can be specified by using \code{method = method_bayes()}.
\item Approximate Bayesian MI based on bootstrapping: \code{draws} returns
the draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters using an approximate Bayesian approach,
where the sampling from the posterior distribution is simulated by fitting the MMRM model
on bootstrap samples of the original dataset. This method can be specified by using
\verb{method = method_approxbayes()]}.
\item Conditional mean imputation with bootstrap re-sampling: \code{draws} returns the
MMRM parameter estimates from the original dataset and from \code{n_samples} bootstrap samples.
This method can be specified by using \code{method = method_condmean()} with
argument \code{type = "bootstrap"}.
\item Conditional mean imputation with jackknife re-sampling: \code{draws} returns the
MMRM parameter estimates from the original dataset and from each leave-one-subject-out sample.
This method can be specified by using \code{method = method_condmean()} with
argument \code{type = "jackknife"}.
}

Bayesian MI based on MCMC sampling has been proposed in Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013) who first introduced
reference-based imputation methods. Approximate Bayesian MI is discussed in Little and Rubin (2002).
Conditional mean imputation methods are discussed in Wolbers et al (2021).

The argument \code{data} contains the longitudinal data. It must have at least the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{subjid}: a factor vector containing the subject ids.
\item \code{visit}: a factor vector containing the visit the outcome was observed on.
\item \code{group}: a factor vector containing the group that the subject belongs to.
\item \code{outcome}: a numeric vector containing the outcome variable. It might contain missing values.
Additional baseline or time-varying covariates must be included in \code{data}.
}

\code{data} must have one row per visit per subject. This means that incomplete
outcome data must be set as \code{NA} instead of having the related row missing. Missing values
in the covariates are not allowed. If \code{data} is incomplete
then the \code{\link[=expand_locf]{expand_locf()}} helper function can be used to add in any missing rows, which uses
Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation to impute the covariates values.
Note that LOCF is generally not a principled imputation method and should only be used when appropriate
for the specific covariate.

Please note that there is no special provisioning for the baseline outcome values. If you do not want baseline
observations to be included in the model as part of the response variable then these should be removed in advance
from the outcome variable in \code{data}. At the same time if you want to include the baseline outcome as covariate in
the model, then this should be included as a separate column of \code{data} (as any other covariate).

The argument \code{data_ice} contains information about the occurrence of ICEs. It is a
\code{data.frame} with 3 columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Subject ID}: a character vector containing the ids of the subjects that experienced
the ICE. This column must be named as specified in \code{vars$subjid}.
\item \strong{Visit}: a character vector containing the first visit after the occurrence of the ICE
(i.e. the first visit affected by the ICE).
The visits must be equal to one of the levels of \code{data[[vars$visit]]}.
If multiple ICEs happen for the same subject, then only the first non-MAR visit should be used.
This column must be named as specified in \code{vars$visit}.
\item \strong{Strategy}: a character vector specifying the imputation strategy to address the ICE for this subject.
This column must be named as specified in \code{vars$strategy}.
Possible imputation strategies are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"MAR"}: Missing At Random.
\item \code{"CIR"}: Copy Increments in Reference.
\item \code{"CR"}: Copy Reference.
\item \code{"JR"}: Jump to Reference.
\item \code{"LMCF"}: Last Mean Carried Forward.
For explanations of these imputation strategies, see Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013), Cro et al (2021),
and Wolbers et al (2021).
Please note that user-defined imputation strategies can also be set.
}
}

The \code{data_ice} argument is necessary at this stage since (as explained in Wolbers et al (2021)), the model is fitted
after removing the observations which are incompatible with the imputation model, i.e.
any observed data on or after \code{data_ice[[vars$visit]]} that are addressed with an imputation
strategy different from MAR are excluded for the model fit. However such observations
will not be discarded from the data in the imputation phase
(performed with the function (\code{\link[=impute]{impute()}}). To summarize, \strong{at this stage only pre-ICE data
and post-ICE data that is after ICEs for which MAR imputation is specified are used}.

If the \code{data_ice} argument is omitted, or if a subject doesn't have a record within \code{data_ice}, then it is
assumed that all of the relevant subject's data is pre-ICE and as such all missing
visits will be imputed under the MAR assumption and all observed data will be used to fit the base imputation model.
Please note that the ICE visit cannot be updated via the \code{update_strategy} argument
in \code{\link[=impute]{impute()}}; this means that subjects who didn't have a record in \code{data_ice} will always have their
missing data imputed under the MAR assumption even if their strategy is updated.

The \code{vars} argument is a named list that specifies the names of key variables within
\code{data} and \code{data_ice}. This list is created by \code{\link[=set_vars]{set_vars()}} and contains the following named elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{subjid}: name of the column in \code{data} and \code{data_ice} which contains the subject ids variable.
\item \code{visit}: name of the column in \code{data} and \code{data_ice} which contains the visit variable.
\item \code{group}: name of the column in \code{data} which contains the group variable.
\item \code{outcome}: name of the column in \code{data} which contains the outcome variable.
\item \code{covariates}: vector of characters which contains the covariates to be included
in the model (including interactions which are specified as "covariateName1*covariateName2").
If no covariates are provided the default model specification of \code{outcome ~ 1 + visit + group} will be used.
Please note that the \code{group*visit} interaction
is \strong{not} included in the model by default.
\item \code{strata}: covariates used as stratification variables in the bootstrap sampling.
By default only the \code{vars$group} is set as stratification variable.
Needed only for \code{method_condmean(type = "bootstrap")} and \code{method_approxbayes()}.
\item \code{strategy}: name of the column in \code{data_ice} which contains the subject-specific imputation strategy.
