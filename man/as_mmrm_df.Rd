\title{Creates a "MMRM" ready dataset}
\usage{
as_mmrm_df(designmat, outcome, visit, subjid, group = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{designmat}{a \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} containing the covariates to use in the MMRM model.
Dummy variables must already be expanded out, i.e. via \code{\link[stats:model.matrix]{stats::model.matrix()}}. Cannot contain
any missing values}

\item{outcome}{a numeric vector. The outcome value to be regressed on in the MMRM model.}

\item{visit}{a character / factor vector. Indicates which visit the outcome value occurred on.}

\item{subjid}{a character / factor vector. The subject identifier used to link separate visits
that belong to the same subject.}

\item{group}{a character / factor vector. Indicates which treatment group the patient belongs to.
Will internally be converted to a factor if it is a character vector.}
}
\description{
Converts a design matrix + key variables into a common format
In particular this function does the following:
\itemize{
\item Renames all covariates as \code{V1}, \code{V2}, etc to avoid issues of special characters in variable names
\item Ensures all key variables are of the right type
\item Inserts the outcome, visit and subjid variables into the \code{data.frame}
naming them as \code{outcome}, \code{visit} and \code{subjid}
\item If provided will also insert the group variable into the \code{data.frame} named as \code{group}
}
}
