\title{Construct random effects formula}
\usage{
random_effects_expr(cov_struct = c("us", "toep", "cs", "ar1"), group = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cov_struct}{a character value. Specifies which covariance structure to use. Must be one of
\code{"us"}, \code{"toep"}, \code{"cs"} or  \code{"ar1"}}

\item{group}{a character / factor vector. Used to indicate which treatment group the patient belongs to.}
}
\description{
Constructs a character representation of the random effects formula
for fitting a MMRM for subject by visit in the format required for glmmTMB.
}
\details{
assuming the user specified a covariance structure of "us" and that no groups
were provided this will return\preformatted{us(0 + visit | subjid)
}

If groups is provided then this indicates that separate covariance matrices
are required per group and as such the following will be returned:\preformatted{us( 0 + group1:visit | subjid) + us(0 + group2:visit | subjid) + ...
}
}
