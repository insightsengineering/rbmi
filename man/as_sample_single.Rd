\item \code{sigma} list of estimated covariance matrices (one for each level of \code{vars$group}).
\item \code{theta} numeric vector of transformed covariances.
\item \code{failed} logical. \code{TRUE} if the model fit failed.
\item \code{ids_samp} vector of characters containing the ids of the subjects included in the given sample.
