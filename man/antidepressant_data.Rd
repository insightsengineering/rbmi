\title{Antidepressant trial data.}
\format{
A data frame with 608 rows and 11 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{PATIENT}: patients IDs.
\item \code{HAMATOTL}: total score Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.
\item \code{PGIIMP}: patient’s Global Impression of Improvement Rating Scale.
\item \code{RELDAYS}: number of days between visit and baseline.
\item \code{VISIT}: post-baseline visit. Has levels 4,5,6,7.
\item \code{THERAPY}: the treatment group variable. It is equal to \code{PLACEBO} for observations from the placebo arm, or \code{DRUG} for observations from the active arm.
\item \code{GENDER}: patient's gender.
\item \code{POOLINV}: pooled investigator.
\item \code{BASVAL}: baseline outcome value.
\item \code{HAMDTL17}: Hamilton 17-item rating scale value.
\item \code{CHANGE}: change from baseline in the Hamilton 17-item rating scale.

\description{
A dataset containing data from a publicly available example data set from an antidepressant clinical trial.
The dataset is available on the website of the
\href{https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/missing-data#dia-missing-data}{Drug Information Association Scientific Working Group on Estimands and Missing Data}.
As per that website, the original data are from an antidepressant clinical trial with four treatments; two doses of an experimental medication,
a positive control, and placebo and was published in Goldstein et al (2004). To mask the real data, week 8 observations were removed and two arms were created:
the original placebo arm and a “drug arm” created by randomly selecting patients from the three non-placebo arms.
}
\details{
The relevant endpoint is the Hamilton 17-item rating scale for depression (HAMD17) for which baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 assessments are included.
Study drug discontinuation occurred in 24\% subjects from the active drug and 26\% from placebo.
All data after study drug discontinuation are missing and there is a single additional intermittent missing observation.
