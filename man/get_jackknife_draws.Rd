\title{Fit the base imputation model for the jackknife procedure}
\usage{
get_jackknife_draws(longdata, method, ncores = 1, stack = Stack$new())
}
\arguments{
\item{longdata}{R6 \code{longdata} object containing all relevant input data information.}

\item{method}{A \code{method} object as generated by \code{\link[=method_condmean]{method_condmean()}} with \code{type = "jackknife"}.}

\item{ncores}{Number of processes to parallise the job over}

\item{stack}{A R6 stack instance. Ignore this is only used for unit testing purposes}
}
\value{
A \code{draws} object which is a named list containing the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: R6 \code{longdata} object containing all relevant input data information.
\item \code{method}: A \code{method} object as generated by either \code{\link[=method_bayes]{method_bayes()}},
\code{\link[=method_approxbayes]{method_approxbayes()}} or \code{\link[=method_condmean]{method_condmean()}}.
\item \code{samples}: list containing the estimated parameters of interest.
Each element of \code{samples} is a named list containing the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{ids}: vector of characters containing the ids of the subjects included in the original dataset.
\item \code{beta}: numeric vector of estimated regression coefficients.
\item \code{sigma}: list of estimated covariance matrices (one for each level of \code{vars$group}).
\item \code{theta}: numeric vector of transformed covariances.
\item \code{failed}: Logical. \code{TRUE} if the model fit failed.
\item \code{ids_samp}: vector of characters containing the ids of the subjects included in the given sample.
}
\item \code{fit}: if \code{method_bayes()} is chosen, returns the MCMC Stan fit object. Otherwise \code{NULL}.
\item \code{n_failures}: absolute number of failures of the model fit.
Relevant only for \code{method_condmean(type = "bootstrap")} and \code{method_approxbayes()}.
\item \code{formula}: fixed effects formula object used for the model specification.
}
}
\description{
Fit the base imputation model using a ML/REML approach on the original dataset
and on each leave-one-subject-out sample as per the jackknife procedure. Returns the
parameter estimates from all the fits.
}
\details{
If there is a model fit failure, the process stops and an error is displayed.
