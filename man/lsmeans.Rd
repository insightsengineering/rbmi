\title{Least Square Means}
\usage{
lsmeans(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model created by lm}

\item{...}{Fixes specific variables to specific values i.e.
\code{trt = 1} or \code{age = 50}. The name of the argument must be the name
of the variable within the dataset}
}
\description{
Estimates the least square means from a linear model. This is
essentially where we generate a prediction from the model
by fitting it to some hypothetical observation that is constructed
by averaging the data. See details for more information.
}
\details{
Numeric variables are evaluated at the mean across the entire dataset
(after removing missing values)
Factor variables are evaluated at all levels (including combinations
with other factor variables) with the final return value being
average across all the predictions generated at each of these levels.

Use the \code{...} argument to fix specific variables to specific values.

See the references for identical implementations as done in SAS and via
the emmeans package. This function attempts to re-implement the
emmeans derivation for standard lm's but without having to include
all of their dependencies

mod <- lm( Sepal.Length ~ Species + Petal.Length, data = iris)
lsmeans(mod)
lsmeans(mod, Species = "virginica")

lsmeans(mod, Species = "versicolor", Petal.Length = 1)
