\title{Least Square Means}
\usage{
lsmeans(model, ..., .weights = c("proportional", "equal"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model created by \code{lm}.}

\item{...}{Fixes specific variables to specific values i.e.
\code{trt = 1} or \code{age = 50}. The name of the argument must be the name
of the variable within the dataset.}

\item{.weights}{Character, specifies whether to use "proportional" or "equal" weighting for each
categorical covariate combination when calculating the lsmeans.}
}
\description{
Estimates the least square means from a linear model. The exact implementation
/ interpretation depends on the weighting scheme; see details for more information.
}
\details{
For \code{.weights = "proportional"} (the default) the lsmeans are obtained by
taking the average of the fitted values for each patient.
In terms of the interactions between two continuous covariates
this is equivalent to constructing a hypothetical patient whose
interaction term is \code{mean(X * Y)}. This is opposed to the
\code{emmeans} package which calculates the interaction term
of the hypothetical patient as \code{mean(X) * mean(Y)}. The approach
outlined here is equivalent to standardization or g-computation.

For \code{.weights = "equal"} the lsmeans are obtained by taking the model fitted
value of a hypothetical patient whose covariates are defined as follows:
\itemize{
\item Continuous covariates are set to \code{mean(X)}
\item Dummy categorical variables are set to \code{1/N} where \code{N} is the number of levels
\item Continuous * continuous interactions are set to \code{mean(X) * mean(Y)}
\item Continuous * categorical interactions are set to \code{mean(X) * 1/N}
}

Regardless of the weighting scheme any named arguments passed via \code{...} will
fix the value of the covariate to the specified value.
For example, \code{lsmeans(model, trt = "A")} will fix the dummy variable \code{trtA} to 1
for all patients (real or hypothetical) when calculating the lsmeans.

See the references for similar implementations as done in SAS and
in R via the \code{emmeans} package.
