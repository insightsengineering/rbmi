\title{Expand and fill in missing dataframe rows}
\usage{
expand(data, ...)

fill_locf(data, vars, group = NULL, order = NULL)

expand_locf(data, ..., vars, group, order)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset to expand or fill in}

\item{...}{variables and the levels that should be expanded out (note that duplicate entries of
levels will result in multiple rows for that level)}

\item{vars}{character vector containing the names of variables that need to be filled in}

\item{group}{character vector containing the names of variables to group
by when performing LOCF imputation of \code{var}}

\item{order}{character vector containing the names of additional variables to sort the dataframe
by before performing LOCF}
}
\description{
These functions are essentially wrappers around \code{\link[base:expand.grid]{base::expand.grid()}} to ensure that missing
combinations of data are inserted into a dataframe with imputation/fill methods for updating
covariate values of newly created rows
}
\details{
The \code{\link[=draws]{draws()}} function makes the assumption that all subjects and visits are present in the dataframe
and that all covariate values are none missing; \code{expand()}, \code{fill_locf()} and \code{expand_locf()} are utility
functions to support users in ensuring that their dataframes conform to these assumptions.

\code{expand()} takes vectors for expected levels in a dataframe and expands out all combinations inserting any
missing rows into the dataframe. Note that all "expanded" variables are cast as factors.

\code{fill_locf()} applies LOCF imputation to named covariates to fill in any NAs created by the insertion of new
rows by \code{expand()} (though do note that no distinction is made between existing NAs and newly created NAs).
Note that the dataframe is sorted by \code{c(group, order)} before performing the LOCF imputation; the dataframe
will be returned in the original sort order however.

\code{expand_locf()} a simple composition function of \code{fill_locf()} and \code{expand()} i.e. \code{fill_locf(expand(...))}

\examples{
\dontrun{

dat_expanded <- expand(
    data = dat,
    subject = c("pt1", "pt2", "pt3", "pt4"),
    visit = c("vis1", "vis2", "vis3")
)

dat_filled <- fill_loc(
    data = dat_expanded,
    vars = c("Sex", "Age"),
    group = "subject",
    order = "visit"
)

## Or

dat_filled <- expand_locf(
    data = dat,
    subject = c("pt1", "pt2", "pt3", "pt4"),
    visit = c("vis1", "vis2", "vis3"),
    vars = c("Sex", "Age"),
    group = "subject",
    order = "visit"
)
}
