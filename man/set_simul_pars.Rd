\title{Set simulation parameters of a study group.}
\usage{
set_simul_pars(
  mu,
  sigma,
  n,
  prob_ice1 = 0,
  or_outcome_ice1 = 1,
  prob_post_ice1_dropout = 0,
  prob_dropout = 0,
  prob_miss = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Numeric vector describing the mean outcome trajectory at each visit (including
baseline) assuming no ICEs.}

\item{sigma}{Covariance matrix of the outcome trajectory assuming no ICEs.}

\item{n}{Number of subjects belonging to the group.}

\item{prob_ice1}{Numeric vector that specifies the probability of experiencing ICE1
(discontinuation from study treatment due to SDCR reasons) after each visit for a subject
with observed outcome at that visit equal to the mean at baseline (\code{mu[1]}).
If a single numeric is provided, then the same probability is applied to each visit.}

\item{or_outcome_ice1}{Numeric value that specifies the odds ratio of experiencing ICE1 after
each visit corresponding to a +1 higher value of the observed outcome at that visit.}

\item{prob_post_ice1_dropout}{Numeric value that specifies the probability of study
drop-out following ICE1. If a subject is simulated to drop-out after ICE1, all outcomes after
ICE1 are set to missing.}

\item{prob_dropout}{Numeric that specifies an additional probability that a post-baseline
visit is affected by study drop-out. Outcome data at the subject's first simulated visit
affected by study drop-out and all subsequent visits are set to missing.
In case the subject's first simulated visit affected by study drop-out is prior to ICE1
(i.e. in case the subject is still on study treatment), then it is assumed that the study
drop-out also triggers discontinuation due the NSDRC reasons
and a corresponding intercurrent event ICE2 is generated.}

\item{prob_miss}{Numeric value that specifies an additional probability for a given
post-baseline observation to be missing. This can be used to produce
"intermittent" missing values which are not associated with any ICE.}
}
\value{
A \code{simul_pars} object which is a named list containing the simulation parameters.
}
\description{
This function provides input arguments for each study group needed to
simulate data with \code{\link[=simulate_data]{simulate_data()}}. \code{\link[=simulate_data]{simulate_data()}} generates data for a two-arms
clinical trial with longitudinal continuous outcomes and two intercurrent events (ICEs).
ICE1 may be thought of as a discontinuation from study treatment due to study drug or
condition related (SDCR) reasons. ICE2 may be thought of as discontinuation from study
treatment due to uninformative study drop-out, i.e. due to not study drug or
condition related (NSDRC) reasons and outcome data after ICE2 is always missing.
