\title{Evaluate a call to mmrm}
\usage{
eval_mmrm(expr)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An expression to be evaluated. Should be a call to \code{\link[mmrm:mmrm]{mmrm::mmrm()}}.}
}
\description{
This is a utility function that attempts to evaluate a call to mmrm
managing any warnings or errors that are thrown.
}
\details{
This function was originally developed for use with \code{glmmTMB} which needed
more hand-holding and dropping of false-positive warnings. It is not
as important now but is kept around encase we need to catch
false-positive warnings again in the future.
