#'
#' @description
#' Creates a `data.frame` in the format required by [analyse()] for the use
#' of applying a delta adjustment.
#'
#' @details
#' To apply a delta adjustment the [analyse()] function expects
#' a delta `data.frame` with 3 variables: `vars$subjid`, `vars$visit` and `delta`
#' (where `vars` is the object supplied in the original call to [draws()]
#' as created by the [set_vars()] function).
#'
#' This function will return a `data.frame` with the aforementioned variables with one
#' row per subject per visit. If the `delta` argument to this function is `NULL`
#' then the `delta` column in the returned `data.frame` will be 0 for all observations.
#' If the `delta` argument is not `NULL` then `delta` will be calculated separately
#' for each subject as the accumulative sum of `delta` multiplied by the scaling
#' coefficient `dlag` based upon how many visits after the subject's intercurrent
#' event (ICE) the visit in question is.
#' This is best illustrated with an example:
#'
#' Let `delta = c(5,6,7,8)` and `dlag=c(1,2,3,4)` (i.e. assuming there are 4 visits)
#' and lets say that the subject had an ICE on visit 2. The calculation would then be
#' as follows:
#'
#' ```
#' v1  v2  v3  v4
#' --------------
#'  5   6   7   8  # delta assigned to each visit
#'  0   1   2   3  # lagged scaling starting from the first visit after the subjects ICE
#' --------------
#'  0   6  14  24  # delta * lagged scaling
#' --------------
#'  0   6  20  44  # accumulative sum of delta to be applied to each visit
#' ```
#'
#' That is to say the subject would have a delta offset of 0 applied for visit-1, 6
#' for visit-2, 20 for visit-3 and 44 for visit-4. As a comparison, lets say that the
#' subject instead had their ICE on visit 3, the calculation would then be as follows:
#'
#' ```
#' v1  v2  v3  v4
#' --------------
#'  5   6   7   8  # delta assigned to each visit
#'  0   0   1   2  # lagged scaling starting from the first visit after the subjects ICE
#' --------------
#'  0   0   7  16  # delta * lagged scaling
#' --------------
#'  0   0   7  23  # accumulative sum of delta to be applied to each visit
#' ```
#'
#' In terms of practical usage, lets say that you wanted a delta of 5 to be used for all post ICE visits
#' regardless of their proximity to the ICE visit. This can be achieved by setting
#' `delta = c(5,5,5,5)` and `dlag = c(1,0,0,0)`. For example lets say a subject had their
#' ICE on visit-1, then the calculation would be as follows:
#'
#' ```
#' v1  v2  v3  v4
#' --------------
#'  5   5   5   5  # delta assigned to each visit
#'  1   0   0   0  # lagged scaling starting from the first visit after the subjects ICE
#' --------------
#'  5   0   0  0  # delta * lagged scaling
#' --------------
#'  5   5   5  5  # accumulative sum of delta to be applied to each visit
#' ```
#'
#' Another way of using these arguments
#' is to set `delta` to be the difference in time between visits and `dlag` to be the
#' amount of delta per unit of time. For example lets say that we have a visit on weeks
#' 1, 5, 6 & 9 and that we want a delta of 3 to be applied for each week after an ICE. This
#' can be achieved by setting `delta = c(0,4,1,3)` (the difference in weeks between each visit)
#' and `dlag = c(3, 3, 3, 3)`. For example lets say we have a subject who had their ICE on week-5
#' (i.e. visit-2) then the calculation would be:
#'
#' ```
#' v1  v2  v3  v4
#' --------------
#'  0   4   1   3  # delta assigned to each visit
#'  0   0   3   3  # lagged scaling starting from the first visit after the subjects ICE
#' --------------
#'  0   0   3   9  # delta * lagged scaling
#' --------------
#'  0   0   3  12  # accumulative sum of delta to be applied to each visit
#' ```
#'
#' i.e. on week-6 (1 week after the ICE) they have a delta of 3 and on week-9 (4 weeks after the ICE)
#' they have a delta of 12.
#'
#'
#' Please note that this function also returns several utility variables so that
#' the user can create their own custom logic for defining what `delta`
#' should be set to. These additional variables include:
#'
#' - `is_mar` - If the observation was missing would it be regarded as MAR? This variable
#' is set to `FALSE` for observations that occurred after a non-MAR ICE, otherwise it is set to `TRUE`.
#' - `is_missing` - Is the outcome variable for this observation missing.
#' - `is_post_ice` - Does the observation occur after the patient's ICE as defined by the
#' `data_ice` dataset supplied to [draws()].
#' - `strategy` - What imputation strategy was assigned to for this subject.
#'
#'
#' The design and implementation of this function is largely based upon the same functionality
#' as implemented in the so called "five marcos" by James Roger. See Roger (2021).

#' @param imputations an `imputation` object as created by [impute()].
#'
#' @param delta `NULL` or a numeric vector. Determines the baseline amount of delta
#' to be applied to each visit. See details. If a numeric vector it must have
#' the same length as the number of unique visits in the original dataset.
#'
#' @param dlag `NULL` or a numeric vector. Determines the scaling to be applied
#' to `delta` based upon which visit the ICE occurred on. See details. If a
#' numeric vector it must have the same length as the number of unique visits in
#' the original dataset.
#'
#' @param missing_only Logical, if `TRUE` then non-missing post-ICE data will have a delta value
#' of 0 assigned. Note that the calculation (as described in the details section) is performed
#' first and then overwritten with 0's at the end (i.e. the delta values for missing
#' post-ICE visits will stay the same regardless of this option).
