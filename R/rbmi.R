#' select between various standard Bayesian and frequentist approaches.
#'
#' The package is designed around 4 core functions:
#' - [draws()] - Fits multiple imputation models
#' - [impute()] - Imputes multiple datasets
#' - [analyse()] - Analyses multiple datasets
#' - [pool()] - Pools multiple results into a single statistic
#'
