## Summary of Submission

In this version I have:

* Updated our Stan syntax to ensure future compatibility
* Updated our package description to contain relevant references
* Fixed several typos in our documentation

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were 2 NOTEs:

❯ checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 55.6Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs  54.3Mb

- This is a consequence of using Rstan which produces quite large binaries when compiled. As far as I'm aware there is no way for us to reduce this and is dependent on the Stan development team. Our understanding from the [developers](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/using-rstan-in-an-r-package-generates-r-cmd-check-notes/26628) is that this is acceptable to ignore.


❯ checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... NOTE
  GNU make is a SystemRequirements.

- This is a consequence of using Rstan which requires us to use GNU make to compile the Stan model as per their package usage instructions which can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstantools/vignettes/minimal-rstan-package.html).
